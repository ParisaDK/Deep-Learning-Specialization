# Deep-Learning-Specialization
A collection of programming assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), showcasing my progress on deep learning  


## Overview

This repository is dedicated to only the programming assignments from the 4th and 5th courses:
- **4th Course**: [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/)
- **5th Course**: [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
